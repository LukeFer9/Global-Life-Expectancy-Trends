# Global Life Expectancy Trends
 Source data for this project was found at [Life expectancy and Socio-Economic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank). \
 Foundations for the 'WorldGeo.geojson' file were found at [D3-Graph-Gallery](https://github.com/holtzy/D3-graph-gallery/blob/master/DATA/world.geojson?short_path=84c0615).

 This project is a demonstration of visualization tools designed to aid in the analysis of life expectancy trends for different countries, leading up to COVID-19.
 The tools include interactive features that allow a user to focus their analyses based on a specific country.
